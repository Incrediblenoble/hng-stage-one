# Number Classifier API

The Number Classifier API is a simple Node.js-based API that classifies numbers as even or odd. It leverages the Express framework to handle HTTP requests, uses CORS to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and employs body-parser to parse JSON request bodies. This project is a great starting point for those looking to understand and work with RESTful APIs in Node.js.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a simple and efficient way to classify numbers as even or odd through a RESTful API. Users can send a number as a query parameter, and the API will respond with whether the number is even or odd. This can be useful for educational purposes, learning about API development, or serving as a base for more complex projects.

The API is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. It includes detailed error handling to ensure that users receive meaningful feedback when providing invalid input.

## Features

- **Simple and Easy-to-Use API:** The API provides a straightforward interface for classifying numbers.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** CORS is enabled to allow requests from different origins.
- **JSON Body Parsing:** The API can parse JSON request bodies using body-parser.
- **Detailed Error Handling:** The API provides meaningful error messages for invalid input.
- **Scalable Structure:** The project structure allows for easy expansion and addition of new features.
